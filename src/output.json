      "I\u2019ve been coding, starting what little I could at the age of 10 with the information and hardware I had available, 40 years ago.  I would have killed for something like Stack Overflow.  The information I had available until I was an adult was limited to what I could walk to get at the public library (school and local city library) and walking distance bookstores.  I had to learn a lot of stuff from what I had, and then translate/find parallels to what I had to work with in practice.  That\u2019s one skill that transfers incredibly well regardless of time/space/platform, and I\u2019d need to take a bit of time to count how many I\u2019ve worked with.\n\nHere is one that can help avoid needless time spent debugging later, that also is 100% transferrable: ensure all variables are explicitly initialized to a valid terminal state as early as possible.  What do I mean by that?\n1.  If it isn\u2019t otherwise changed to indicate that something was successful, it should be set to an error value.  This is what\u2019s returned by default.\n2.  If it isn\u2019t otherwise changed to indicate something failed (any operation succeeds unless that in particular fails) set it to a success value.  I prefer #1, less room to go wrong: use that FIRST because you can always go back later.  Just set it to a generic \u201cerror code not explicitly stated\u201d general error: you should never return a general error: what good is a general error?\n3.  Initialize any arrays or variables to a known-good safe state at the very beginning, so you have 100% repeatability every time you call that function.  This is even more important to remember when you work with non-deterministic systems, because all the determinism you can muster helps debugging be far more efficient.\n\nGetting into these habits will save you countless hours of debugging for what are often the dumbest of mistakes of execution or misunderstanding of the problem.  A 100% repeatable bug is the easiest bug to identify it is a bug, and  where it is at, and how to fix: accept no substitutes in your code by implementing this habit by default!  Code reviewers of any value will love you for it.  So will customers!  The most obnoxious software as a user is the software that you wonder if you will have it work correctly or at least the same way, given the same input, every time.",

One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you\u2019ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You\u2019ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\n\n*Let\u2019s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a \u201cwhite\u201d lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you\u2019ve lusted, you\u2019ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\n\nIf you\u2019ve hated someone, the Bible says you\u2019re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you\u2019ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell.

(Luke 24:46-48)\n\nRepent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don\u2019t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.\n\nDo you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.\n\n.

    "main_comment": "Great list. \n\nOne \u2018habit\u2019 I would suggest is to \u2018take an empirical view\u2019. Come up with theories. Do experiments. Disprove those theories. Basically, apply the scientific method. So much of programming is about discovery, not invention. Once you have discovered a way that works, a theory that seems correct, you can experiment to find out why, and iterate towards a way that works faster, less memory, less code etc. \n\nThat\u2019s why physicists make the best programmers \ud83d\ude09\n\nA second I would consider, somewhat related to the first, is \u2018knowing when to stop\u2019. One of my teachers said to me \u2018a program is never finished\u2019. You can always spend more time refactoring, tidying up, adding more tests, trying different libraries or versions of libraries, polishing the code; but in a production environment you have to know when to stop - perfection being the enemy of good enough. And not good enough being the enemy of acceptable. \n\nYou have to put a limit on your OCD. \n\nA final one for consideration; the right tool for the job. This could be considered under \u2018domain knowledge\u2019? Anyways, this was a favourite saying of another of my teachers. They pointed out that using the right tool can be 100 times faster (in dev time) than using the wrong one. Like if you have a hammer, every problem is treated like a nail. It\u2019s always worth hunting around to see if there already exists a tool for your problem.  Eg I once had 85 lines of code replaced by one line of (very cunning) sql. It\u2019s a trade off between time spent looking/asking vs time spent coding!\n\nI can\u2019t help but add a further one. Breadth and depth of knowledge. Spend some time getting to know the full stack. Read about, I don\u2019t know, Networks - how do they work? Databases - how do they actually work, web servers? What\u2019s really going on? If a bug leads you down a rabbit hole to some issue with eg DNS settings or port mappings - take a few extra minutes to find out more about them while you are there - rather than just the absolute minimum to fix what you need. You will be better prepared next time!",
